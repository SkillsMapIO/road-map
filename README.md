# SkillsMap.io feature roadmap

This is the public SkillsMap roadmap. This is a place for our customers to view our roadmap, vote on the features and add new feature requests as appropriate.  We will use this to communicate progress as we work through the roadmap.  Keep in mind that outside of 'short term' features this will change fairly regularly.

## Contribution Guidelines

You can interact with our roadmap in two ways:

1) Create feature requests (and log bugs) - If there is something that SkillsMap.io does not currently do and you would like it to, (and there isn't an existing issue) please feel free to create an issue with as much detail as you feel comfortable entering.

2) Vote on feature requests - please use GitHub's reactions to indicate interest in a feature or bug fix. We are keen to understand the most important features for our customers in order to assist us with improving our product.

## Short-term, medium-term, long-term

These are relative timeframes recognizing that we are a small startup and may need to change directions rather rapidly.  As such, they should only be taken as 'short-term': next 2 - 3 months, 'medium-term': 3 - 6 months, 'long-term': 6 - 12 months.
